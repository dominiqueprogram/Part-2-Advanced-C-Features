1.Instructions for how to compile and run the software; 

The Recipe App is a software application that allows users to manage and explore recipes. 
Upon running the application, users are presented with a menu of options, including adding a recipe, displaying all recipes, 
selecting a recipe to view its details, or exiting the app. 
When adding a recipe, users are prompted to enter the recipe's name, ingredients, and steps. 
The app validates the input and stores the recipe in memory. When displaying all recipes, the app lists them in alphabetical order. 
Choosing to view a specific recipe presents a list of available recipes, 
and upon selection, the app displays the recipe's name, ingredients, and steps. 
Additionally, the app calculates the total calories of the recipe and displays it. 
If the total calories exceed 300, a warning message is shown. 
The Recipe App provides a user-friendly interface to interact with recipes, 
making it convenient for users to manage their cooking endeavors.

3. A brief description (100 to 200 words) of what I changed based on the lecturerâ€™s
feedback.

In the provided code, several improvements were made to enhance the presentation and user experience of the recipe app. 
Firstly, color styling was added to display different parts of the recipe in distinct colors, 
making it more visually appealing and organized. 
User prompts and messages were modified and color-coded to provide clearer instructions and feedback. 
The menu options were formatted and colored to stand out, separated by asterisks for visual distinction. 
Console output was updated with headings displayed in magenta to highlight important sections. 
These changes collectively aim to improve the readability, user-friendliness, and visual appeal of the recipe app. 
Overall, the additions of color, refined prompts, organized menus, 
and better console output contribute to a more engaging and user-centric experience for the users of the recipe app.
